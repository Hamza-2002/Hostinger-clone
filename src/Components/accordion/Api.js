        question:"What is web hosting?",
        answer:"Web hosting is a service that makes your website available on the internet. When you get a hosting plan, you rent space on a physical server to store all the website’s data and files. There are many types of hosting available, such as shared hosting, WordPress hosting, and VPS. While most web hosting providers offer similar plans, the more popular a website is, the more resources it will need to function effectively.Hostinger helps you scale your hosting plans when you need it. So, you can start with a simple shared hosting plan and gradually upgrade to a cloud hosting or even a VPS hosting plan.The most common types of hosting include: Shared hosting. Multiple websites are hosted on the same server, and each user is allocated a certain amount of storage space and resources. Often, this is the most affordable option available, so it is a great hosting option for hobbyists and bloggers.VPS hosting. A virtual private server (VPS) setup generally uses more powerful hardware, making it possible for the web host to create a virtual partition for each user. It’s an excellent option for users with more advanced technical knowledge. Cloud hosting. In this setup, websites run on multiple virtual or cloud servers – not just one physical server – reducing possible downtime and hardware failure. If you need access to more server power, this type of hosting can be right for you. Dedicated hosting. When you have a dedicated hosting plan, the server is dedicated to your website only – you don’t share storage space or resources with others. A dedicated hosting setup is usually recommended for professional web admins and developers.Here at Hostinger, we aim to provide fast hosting with nearly 100% uptime at a truly unbeatable price."

        question:"How does website hosting work?",
        answer:"Your website is a collection of files and (in most cases) databases that are shown to your visitors as they browse your site. Hostinger, like most web hosts, allocates storage space for your website’s files and databases on a server.When you sign up for Hostinger’s hosting plans, you’ll receive login details to access your hosting account’s admin panel – the hPanel. In hPanel, you can manage all things related to your website, from hosting to domains, databases, files, and so on."
